# Overview
Opinify is a hyperlocal civic engagement platform that empowers citizens to report, discuss, and resolve community issues through poll-based escalation. It bridges the gap between citizens and local governance by providing a transparent, gamified system where community members can report civic issues (potholes, water problems, etc.), vote on priority issues, and track resolution progress. The platform leverages NGO partnerships for verification and creates accountability through real-time tracking and community engagement.
